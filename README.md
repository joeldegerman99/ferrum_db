# Ferrum DB
Ferrum DB is a hobby [DBMS](https://www.appdynamics.com/topics/database-management-systems) project written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

The name *Ferrum* is taken from the periodic table which stands for **Iron** and since iron oxidizes (Rusts) I thought it was a clever name since the programming
lang of this project is **Rust**
